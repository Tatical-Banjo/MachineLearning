# MachineLearning
Random scripts and configs for self learning machine learning stuff.

As most of this work is done on a M1 Macbook Pro, you will see the occasional workaround to make tensorflow behave properly. 

This repo is not designed for others to use, just to collate and doccument my own work in a central location.
